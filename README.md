# Globant's Data Engineering Coding Challenge Advancements

In the following repo, the advancements for the Globant's data engineering coding challenge are presented. The primary objective was to create an API that accomplishes three key tasks:

- Receive historical data from CSV files and upload it to a database.
- Return the number of employees hired for each job and department in 2021, divided by quarter.
- Return a list of IDs, names, and the number of employees hired for each department that hired more employees than the mean of employees hired in 2021 for all departments.

When tackling this coding challenge, various factors needed to be considered. In this case, different implementations were designed with an emphasis on time development, accessibility, and scalability. As a result, both the database and the API are hosted on AWS services due to their provision of free service access, allowing operation within the minimum free tier in terms of computational power and storage. The more information can be found in the pdf in the repository.
